      <h2>Welcome!</h2>

      <p>
        Hi! I’m a software development student graduating in 2025.
        This website serves as a hub to host my educational journey in web
        development at CPCC, and operates under my brand 
        <a href="brand.html">RhinoVision Software</a>. The
        goal of this website is to provide simple, clean, and efficient 
        webpages, which represent various assignments completed throughout my
        journey.<br><br> 
        I have over 2 years of web development 
        experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap/JQuery.
        As well as about a year of experience in software development using
        MySql, Java, Swing, JavaFX, and other Java based tools to create
        software applications.
        I am excited to further my development skills through my 
        classes at CPCC this semester and I’m eager to tackle new challenges 
        and gain new skillsets.<br><br>
        Check out my <a href="introduction.html">introduction</a> to learn 
        more about me. Happy coding to everyone and I hope we all
        have a great semester!</p>
