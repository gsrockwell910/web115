                <strong>Personal Background</strong>:  I grew up in Wilmington, NC,

                <strong>Academic Background</strong>:  I started CFCC 
                (Cape Fear Community College) some 4 years ago, failed 3 of my 4 classes, 
                dropped out and started working HVAC. Once I realized I did not want to do that 
                forever I moved to Charlotte and started pursuing my AAS, Software Development 
                here at CPCC.

                <strong>Background in this Subject</strong>:  I first started studying web development
                 about 2 years ago via The Odin Project and freeCodeCamp. 
                 I earned a certificate in responsive web design from freeCodeCamp, and made it about 
                 halfway through the Ruby section of The Odin Project before I discovered Java 
                 and fell in love. After that I started school here and have had a few web development 
                 classes. I have been working closely with Java for about a year now, so I am looking to 
                 de-rust my web dev skills.
