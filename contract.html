        <h2>Contract</h2>

        <p>I, <a href="introduction.html" target="_blank" data-link="main">Gavin S. Rockwell</a>, 
        agree to abide by the terms in my Fall 2024 WEB115-N801 Web Markup and Scripting class with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen.<br><br>
        I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal websites 
        will be publicly available to the world. I will not put information 
        there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.<br><br>
        I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class.
        As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.<br><br>
        Signed: <i>Gavin S. Rockwell, 20 August 2024.</i></p>
